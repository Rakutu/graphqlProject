# MERN learning Project.
In this project, I learned how to build fullstack applications with the MERN stack.
Also i used Graphql to figure out how it works.

The project was done in haste, so there are some flaws in the code like lint and others that I didn't notice.

#### Stack:
    - Mongoose
    - Express
    - Node.js
    - CRA
    - Typescript
    - Grapql
    - Apollo Client
